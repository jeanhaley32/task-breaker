##Objective
you're going to help me create a program that I can use to try and win a hackathon.
We're goingt o approach this in several ways.

i'm going to brainstorm from here, with your help. We're going to create local design docs, and we're going to create unit tests.

Programming is going to be done by an assortment fo other agents.

when we get to program, what I want you to do is create succint descriptions that we are going to pass to seperate agentic workflows that are
then going to execute on that idea.
