This is sample context data for the AI agent.

The agent's primary objectives:
1. Process and understand context from files
2. Provide intelligent responses based on loaded data
3. Serve as the foundation for more complex agentic workflows

Current capabilities:
- File reading and context loading
- Basic output formatting
- Error handling for file operations

This context will be used to guide the agent's behavior and decision-making processes.
